My Addendum
  Vuex Modules
    - Always end the file nameFull with "Module"
    - Omit 'Module' when importing into the project

Namespacing
  - When using vuex automatic namespacing, use full namespacing syntax even in local dispatch and commit
    - Even though it isn't needed to run, it is easier to read if everything is consistent

  Naming Convention inside modules:
  Getters -
        PascalCase
        always begin first word with:
        - "Get": getting anything not a boolean
        - "Is", "Have" : getting a boolean - depends on what the boolean is for
              - First word should be a delexical verb
                  - https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/en/english-grammar/verbs/delexical-verbs-have-take-make-and-give

  Mutations
    - UPPER_CASE_NAMES


  Actions
    - cameCase
    - if primarily committing a mutation, use same nameFull as mutation but camelCase




   Arguments
    When passing a complex object as an argument
        - If the object is local scope only, end its nameFull with "Blob"
          - example:
                let dataBlob = {
                  prop1: true,
                  prop2: 'some string'
                };
            commit('someMutation', dataBlob);
