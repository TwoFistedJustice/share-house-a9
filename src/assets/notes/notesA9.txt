Need to FIRST have the ablity to create a HOUSE!!!!!
The very first thing it should do when a user logs in:
  See if they belong to a house, if not, then create or join
    a Modal should work.

Need to create supplies form

Store User is trying to patch to localhost instead of to firebase
  - database URL not referenced in  main



Idea to simplify joining a house: for A10

Let people choose whatever nameFull they like
Then give them a short numeric code 3 or 4 numbers- sequential n+1
they enter the house nameFull in one input using the alpha keyboard
then they enter the code in another, using phone dialer
The admin gets to accept or deny a new member
      - this might require Cordova
